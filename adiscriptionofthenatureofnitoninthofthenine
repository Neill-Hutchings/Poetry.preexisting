Brightest, fairest Nito,
Resplendent in his radiance—
in the weight and breadth of his great rage.

Young-borne,
Brightest of the Nine.
A signal of passage.
The mad star, born anew.

He hath spurned the red path of fire.
He hath spurned the heart of all flames—
for it would not yield.

It has rules writ in air and passing.

The yellow smear of Nito’s will is not his own—
and it is without law.

Nito the petulant.
Nito the unruly.
Nito the beautiful.
Nito the unkind.

The Black Tower looms—
an aberration on the horizon,
come too soon.
It casts its weary eyes toward fire—
fire beyond fire—
a fire she’s yet to know, in all her turning.

And Nito gathers unto himself
the makings of his wrathful pyre,
gathers the circles of flame beyond flame,
gathers will, and need, and hunger—

The boundless dominion of night quivers
at this shrieking burning,
recedes at the touch of its dead light.

The meager rules of fire burn.
The dark-bearing aether burns.
Silence burns.

And avaricious Nito—
yearns for yet more.
