And I will judge guilty the innocent.
I shall entomb the robust.
I take all the blood of the young between the great rivers—
to the east and south, by sow-sow-west.

Along a Westerling, all wicked things wander.

Wind runs the river clean,
to the thanks of none but lonesome watchers.

Boards are stones amid the water,
the firmament, the beginnings of known trust.
Man must be separate from the low stream,
thinks himself above the tide.

None trust water save I—
and I know as well that I am wrong
as that you are fools to think any else.

To not trust water
is to as much as lay down and die.
