And all them wandered
through the ole cold dust
that had settled all about,

and they came to each
that was standing—
the captains, the carpenters, the priests—
and each settled their nose on one
and asked:

“Well, what do ya do, boy?”

And he said:
“Well, see sirs, I’m a whore.”

And they nodded,
all of ’em,
and contemplated it
in the grand ole timey ways.

Then they turned to her and said:
“And you, girl?”

And she said:
“Well, see sirs, I’m that… and more.”

And they was greatly confused by this,
as they asked and answered
and got largely the same
from all that was there.

And they began to wonder loudly,
in a sort of general kind of way—
“How is it that all of yas
are working folk?”

And we looked around,
kinda wondering back,
to the general effect of—

“Well… what’s to be done about it?”

And we both just stood there,
looking at each other,
for a long time.
