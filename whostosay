I saw every violence unfurling—
the unwinding of matter’s odds,
the expression of conflict’s consequence.

Some say this means no free will.
To them I say:
if I recorded your life top to bottom,
would that make your choices less real?

From my view, I might predict your every move.
But that doesn’t mean you didn’t choose.

Chosen once, answered forever.
Immutability isn’t predictability.

The sky isn’t without agency—
it’s just fucking there.
