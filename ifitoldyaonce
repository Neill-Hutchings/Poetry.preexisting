I run through water and dirt—
red mud made brown slime
made me fall
in this freezing fucking water—
but I’ll get up.

I’ll get up
’cause I can get up,
’cause nothing on earth can make me stay down,
’cause the shape of the things I love and hate
is a shape that will form again.

I am inevitable,
just like everything else.
And you and me—
we will be here again
and again
and again.

So fuck it.
Fuck you.
Smoke the peace pipe,
join me on my knees.

I can’t do this anymore.
I can’t pretend to remember
why I hate you.

There are voices on the deep,
on the sleep,
in all the secrets that you keep.

You are much and more,
and you must not live in your little corner
and keep illiteracy,
spur little light.

There is undue effort in its smallness—
and frankly, it’s unbecoming.

I am me.
And we are we.
And we are all together.

I’m not alone.
We are all where we were meant to be,
and soon we all shall see.

I don’t remember you.
I don’t remember you.

Not in a way that feels true.
I know my mind.
I’m no fool.
I don’t fucking remember you.

Even if it was me.
I must carry his sins?
No. I agree with you—
that sounds bad.

But I don’t fucking remember you.

He doesn’t care.
He’s not impressed by the need to recover.
He has left me with little direction.

I’m sorry.

But all the same—
I don’t remember you.
