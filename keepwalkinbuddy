There are people in between the people you meet—
at the edge.
The people that don’t talk.
The people you don’t know.

Does anyone know them?
can you know them, is it allowed?

Look at them.

They aren’t right.
Get them out of here.

Run from them—
why aren’t you listening?

I see you.
I see Edgeman.
Whisperer.
The Faint.
The Fae.
I see you.

Sinking in deep waters won’t save you.

I SEE YOU.

I know what you mean—
better than you do.

I know your sickness, your rot.
It’s just part of what you are.
You wouldn’t even recognize it.

You are our common sins:
folly, delusion, perversion, diversion,
addiction, sickness.

I bid ye git—
git, or be murdered
by broadswords in warm moonlight,
as the world spins off
into an infinite malaise of lunacy.

In the kingdom of the mad,
who’s to blame?

Not me. I see you its not me.
