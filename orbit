The middle of my eye is always in the way.
There’s something I need to see at the back—
it wants to be seen.

I must ignore the provocation.
I’m about my business here.
This is old work.
Weird old work.
And I’m gonna find it.

I’ve looked at this hole for hours—
there’s nothing there.
Wet meat.
No mystery.

There’s something in the mirror.
And this thing is always in the fucking way.
