It's right here.

Much as you've come to rely on time and tide, one day the ocean will still.

This ain't just no go round no this is it, of what there was that was all of it. Pendulum's lost its gittiup, I'm afraid.

in strange aons even death may die.

I always took that'a mean there was someways we might over come, conquer death and persist on our own terms. 

I didn't figure on it dying along side us.
