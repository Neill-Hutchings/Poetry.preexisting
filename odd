Weird, Weird, Weird
Weird weird weird weird weird.
Dyed dire.
Weeerird.
Viydir.
Weird bird.

Weird bird,
weird bird.
Strange fowl.
Odd duck.

Fate Equation
Fate—
the equation,
the totality of things.

If time is a map
of matter in movement,
does time have checksums?

Mechanisms of correction?
Levees, shoots, runs.

Dams.

Is all this hate being bottled up?
All these ghosts, swirling—
is this intentional?
Or is it behind
the tools of time
to tame this spoiling tempest?

Slop and Blood
Blood blood blood blood blood blood blood.
Bloud.
Blue clud.
Mud mud mud.

Moving matter.
Organic sludge.
The slop of our progenitors.

We blood our parents’ blood
to fuel our hunger—
and they could be nothing but proud.

To Walk as a God
Gold,
that highest made of metals,
immortal to air and time.

I will breathe gold.
I will fill the spaces of my insides with it
and walk as a god—
till I must make myself anew.

Till I will travel beyond gold,
beyond the configurations of matter
imposed by Logos,
and into the clasping, perfect cycles of being
in which I shall be—
as you are now—
irrelevant.

The Replete
Snake.
Serpent.
Basilisk.
Worm.

The serpent.
The replete.
First of foes found in this new world.

Twin-spined princeling.
Would-be inheritors.

And you don’t know he’s wrong.
Not yet.

In what ways we are the similar
I could not begin to say.
What a second age of serpents could mean.

⸻

The Break
There was a split in us,
a break in our line
somewhere near the beginning.

The shapes of your brains
are the same,
deep down.

⸻

Flight and Forgetting
Strange fowl.
Old crown.

The bones are the marks
we have left
of much of us.

They sacrificed their memory
for flight.

Viydir.
Viiydir.
Viidar.
