Black hooves cut gouges deep in the red soil,
the bull could bear down a great brown bear
such was the strength of its wide neck
and the span of its night moon horn.

Its fathers wore my fathers brand,

gored. that’s the word. that’s the worst way to die.

dead on a bull’s horn,

gored through the gut and trod deep in the mud,

offered up to the sun, run through by bone—

tribute to what newborn god of feral blood.

Will you bear my chariot aloft, kin,
for the sin of your provocation?

I shall not weaken,
even if the death plunge strikes true
I shall not weaken.

I will not allow the horn to pass.

Come then—

fight me, long-backed ford walker,
stone dragger,
son of my father’s pride—fight me,
and let us see for whom this age is named,
whom now is favored of the gods.
