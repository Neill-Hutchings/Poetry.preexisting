And I’ll run rampant through these blood streets
and burn everything that glows red before the sun.

All things made fire for the sake of ending.

This is not a time of dark and woe—
this is cheery, distasteful savagery of heat.

Make high the twisting gout of light, friend.
All things were born to burn.

The words, the deeds, the gods of men will burn.

What their children’s children thought
of the beginning of their end matters not.

But the flame of man—
the consequence of our fear,
the greatest of our violence—

our terrible and capable child,

the star-foe:

Nemesis.
