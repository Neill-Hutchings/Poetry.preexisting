Bound by fate
to ill intent,
born of serpentine star and stone.

Come see,
This seething cycle
of need and ruin.

Youngest and strongest of the Nine,
bright scholar of three voices—
come see,
churning black hell.

He is bereft,
he is bereaver.
He has sown,
so now shall reap.

Come see,
this twisting, gnarled dark.

Harold of nameless words,
namer of the blameless—
come see,
the waning Providence of man.

It will not forget,

Come see,
this broken thing pretend.
